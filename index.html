        <h2>Hello I'm Ruann</h2>
        <p>I'm a freelance filmmaker, photographer and entrepreneur based in Cape Town, South Africa.
            Wanting to inspire, travel, learn and capture stories is what I hope to achieve through my life journey. I enjoy capturing the light in someone's eyes, the colours in a sun set, a care free animal in awe by everyday life.
            It's these hidden stories in life I want to capture, that I want to share, and to use to
            inspire those around me through my work.
            I have obtained a wide variety of experience in: short film, documentaries, social media and
            advertisement. I hope to grow my experience in my field and work with other likeminded people.</p>
        <h2><br>My Story</h2>
        <p>I am born and raised Afrikaans, South African with a desire to create and entertain. I'm a 26 year old filmmaker based in Cape Town, South Africa. Creating stories has always been a passion of mine for most of my life!
            I grew up loving movies and watching them, learning the stories and how they built the world in which I fell in love so much, As YouTube became more of a bigger picture I started dreaming of becoming a Youtuber, wanted to entertain those and enjoy my passion for gaming at the same time, thus growing my passion to tell stories.
            I then went on to study in the art of filmmaking and I learnt as much as I can from teachers and anything I can sink my teeth into about the world of film and the structure of entertainment. I've worked on pretty much all forms of media including: videos from short films, documentaries, advertisements, and social media content.
            As well as graphic designing for: pamphlets, billboards, advertisements and various
            work in D3 modeling and texturing.
            Through my schooling journey my notable achievements are winning the Bronze Standard Bank Ovation Award, where the documentary "Liminal" being awarded the Bronze Standard bank Ovation award as part of the National Arts Festival in Grahams Town, South Africa. I was awarded best digital artist in my final year of studying.
            Thus bringing me to today where I'm a skilled filmmaker that can do anything I set my mind with, my experience involves editing various videos from short films, documentaries, advertisement and various social media content. I also dabbled in graphic designing from pamphlets, billboards, advertisements and various other projects involving graphics designing. I also did various work in D3 modeling and texturing although that could still be improved on.
            I hope to one day to use my skills in telling stories through my work to hopefully inspire others to pursue their journey, the same way as all those films and Youtubers inspired me.</p>
